# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. 

NorthStar Technologies features 4 user personas, and users are able to login as a student searching for a co-op, a student with co-op experience, a co-op advisor, or a system administrator. Each user persona is connected to three Streamlit pages, and we utilized some of the features of Streamlit to limit functionality access by role/persona.
